      <p class="p">
        Bikini Bottom is an underwater city that serves as the main setting of
        SpongeBob SquarePants. Located at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, it is
        where the series' main characters live, and where most of the episodes
        take place.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Bikini Bottom is similar to an average American city. Moreover, Bikini
        Bottom is very similar to Los Angeles, California, in that it can be
        described as a large, crowded and smoggy city, as seen in the episode,
        "Chimps Ahoy". This is true indeed, because the episodes present Bikini
        Bottom in a way of showing a large amount of buildings, especially in
        the downtown area, just a in Los Angeles. The traffic can also be
        congested on much of its roads and freeways in Bikini Bottom during rush
        hour.

        The Krusty Krab is a fast food restaurant located in Bikini Bottom,
        founded and owned by Eugene H. Krabs. It is also the most popular and
        best known restaurant in Bikini Bottom and one of the main locations of
        SpongeBob SquarePants. It first appears in the pilot episode "Help
        Wanted."
      </p>
      <p class="p2">
        Famous for its Krabby Patty burgers, it is the rival to Plankton's
        highly unpopular across-the-street restaurant called the Chum Bucket.
        Its employees are SpongeBob SquarePants, whose role is the fry cook, and
        Squidward Tentacles, who acts as the restaurant's cashier.

        SpongeBob SquarePants (born July 14, 1986[9]) is the titular main
        protagonist of the animated series of the same name. He was designed by
        show creator and former marine biologist, the late Stephen Hillenburg.
        Stephen Hillenburg based SpongeBob on Bob the Sponge, a character he had
        created for his educational book The Intertidal Zone in the late 1980s.
